## PTA Volunteer Checkin
Expanding upon the tool created by Stephen Sherrard for 'Volunteer Sign Up Sheets', I had a need to be able to create a kiosk based check in and out system utilizing the data from the sign up sheets generated within Stephen's Wordpress Plugin. Thus, this simple plugin was born.

It is a single file contained in a folder to do everything from the kiosk page to the pack end admin.  To use the plugin, create a folder in your 'wp-content/plugins/' of your Wordpress installation called 'pta-volunteer-checkin' and then place the 'pta-volunteer-checkin.php' file within that folder. Once you open up the plugins page from within Wordpress, you will be able to activate the plugin called "Volunteer Sign Up Sheets - Kiosk Ultimate".

The plugin is fairly self explainitory. Once you create a signup sheet, creat another wordpress page containing short-code for the kiosk **\[pta_checkin sheet="#"\]** where you will replace the # symbol with the sheet ID you want the kiosk to run. Then navigate to that page and it is all ready for you to use.
